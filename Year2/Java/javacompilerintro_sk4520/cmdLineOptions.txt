Question:
List the command line options you have used to complete this exercise.
For each of them, explain (in <= 2 sentences) what they mean and what they allow you to do.

Answer:

-d <directory> This option allowed me to specify where javac should place the compiled .class files.

--help Allows to see the list of available options.

--source-path, -sourcepath It allows to tell the javac where to look for the source files.

-cp, --class-path, -classpath It allows to add libraries that are necessary for the code to compile.
 It was also used in order to run the compiled files that utilised libraries.
