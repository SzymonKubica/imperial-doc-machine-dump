Multipaxos module:

At the top level the Multipaxos module starts up and spawns the state machine
monitor an all of the servers. Then it receives binding messages from the servers.
Those messages are of the form:
  {:MODULES, replica,  acceptor, leader}
and so they contain the PIDs of the child processes of each server. After that,
the module finishes the binding process by sending all leaders to each replica,
then sending all acceptors and replicas to each leader. Finally, Multipaxos
spawns the clients while passing all replicas to each one of them.

Server module:

Each server module spawns its database, replica, leader and acceptor modules.
After that it provides functionality for forcing servers to crash by inspecting
the config.crash_servers map.

Database module:

Allows for executing transactions, accepts one type of messages:
  {:EXECUTE, transaction}
