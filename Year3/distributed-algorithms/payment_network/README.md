# PaymentNetwork

Payment Network is a simple project aiming to model a network
of clients having accounts holding some money and interacting with
a centralised reserve server to deposit, transfer and withdraw funds.
## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `payment_network` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:payment_network, "~> 0.1.0"}

end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
